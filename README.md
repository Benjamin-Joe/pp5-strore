# Setup
To setup this project I followed the Boutique-Ado walkthrough project with Code Institute. Since the whole project is to create an e commerce store, I user the code institute walkthrough as a guide. Having said that I have not copied the Boutique-Ado walkthrough, I have just followed it loosely to ensure I hit all requirements for a passing grade for PP5. Any code that I have taken from Boutique-Ado will be credited appropriately.
To start this project, I first instelled Django and Django allauth. Then created a project called estore using the startproject command. Once that was done, I created a superuser, Ran the port 8000 server and checked everything was working correctly
